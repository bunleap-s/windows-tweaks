# Universal File Explorer
Windows 10 build 14936 comes with a new Universal app. It is a modern File Explorer, a UWP app which could replace the classic File Explorer in the near future. Here is how it looks like.

As you can see, as of this writing, the application is basically ported from Windows 10 Mobile. It is a touch oriented app, with no Ribbon or toolbar or any shell extensions. It might be interesting for touch screen users.

At this moment, it is too early to say which features the application will get. We only hope it does not replace File Explorer despite having far less functions and features. The Win32 File Explorer could remain as a deprecated legacy app similar to Internet Explorer.
